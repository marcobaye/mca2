mit Shmendric zu echtem Adventure ausbauen:

- Umlaute!
- add automatic word wrap
zwei-Wort-Parser? Inventar!

add items (mobile and fixed), handle as vars (value is location)
	mobile/fixed could be distinguished by sorting (first one, then
		the other, with border value for CMP)
	put at start of var table, because we need to store more info in
	further tables:
		short name to reference (not necessarily the same as the
			name in description file, for translations) - try to
			not have umlauts!
		long name or description for "examine"
	items declared in situation get that sit as default position, all
	others are hidden.

add "drop" command to move item from INVENTORY to HERE
add code sections to execute after "use X with Y" command:
use string with stick
	hide string	# puts item X to "NOWHERE" location
	hide stick
	gain bow	# puts item Z to "INVENTORY" location
		# FIXME - or rather HERE? should depend on item's
		# mobility!
	"You now have a bow"
	if arrow @ inventory
		" to shoot arrows with."
	else
		", pity you do not have arrows."
	endif
use feather with stick
	hide feather
	hide stick
	gain arrow
	"You now have an arrow"
	if bow @ inventory
		" to shoot with your bow"
	else
		", pity you do not have a bow to shoot it."
	endif

conv:
	add "say"
	allow "IF var"
backend:
	add "ifnonzero"

vocabulary:
	north south west east up down
	take drop inventory
	use-X-with-Y

	nord s√ºd west ost hoch runter
	nimm verliere inventar
	benutze-X-mit-Y
